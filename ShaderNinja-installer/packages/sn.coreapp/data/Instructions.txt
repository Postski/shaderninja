To generate the core installation package:
1. compile the .exe (or use the precompiled one already present here, in which case skip step 2).
2. move the .exe here.
3. call deploywinqt.exe passing the .exe as the parameter (or manually add the libraries). The ones here are
   the latest as of 13/09/2015.
   Note that, providing windeployqt.exe is in your Path variable and you're on windows, regen-libs.bat will do this for you.
4. pack everything up (apart from this and the .bat file) into a data.7z file
